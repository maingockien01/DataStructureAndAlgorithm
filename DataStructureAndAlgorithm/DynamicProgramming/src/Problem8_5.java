 * @input       Given n programs P1, P2,..,Pn
 *              a disk with capacity of D megabytes.
 *              Pi requires Si megabytes of storage.
 *              D < sum of Si -> cannot store all P
 *
 *  @output     Maximize the number of programs that a disk can stores.
 *
 *  @question   a) Does a greedy algorithm thay selects programs in order of nondecreasing s maxize the number of programs stored in the disk
 *              b) Does a greedy algorithm that selelcts programs in order of nonincreasing order will maximize the possible capacity of the disk.
