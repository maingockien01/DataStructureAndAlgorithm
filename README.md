Hi there!

Thank you for coming to this rep <3

This rep is my learning progress. As a comp sci student, data structure and algorithm is the foundation of computer science. However, only theory about data structure and algorithm is not enough, implementation is not less important. That's why I decided to learn about data structure and practice by coding. 

I try my best to apply clean code principle as well as OOP principles. My assumption is this library will be used in the future for different projects. That's why I tried to apply generic and different OOP principles so future users can use it easily by adding their needs into the my code (without changing my code!!!).

I know that some of code in this project is not clean so give me your review if you are already here! 

**Objective**: This is what I want to learn and what I have learned. 

- [x] Basic Structure: I underrstanded most of them already from my course in uni
-     [x] Array, Hash array (Dictionary)
-     [x] Linked list, Stack, Queue
-   [x] Graph: graph data structure, graph traversal
- [x] Sorting and Searching
-   [x] Comparing sort: insert, bubble, pivot, heap, merge
-   [x] Distributional sort
-   [x] Search: binary, quick
- [x] Combinatorail search and Heruristic method
-   [x] Backtracking: I learned this from the course but I will try some advance problems.
-   [x] Heuristic method
-     [x] Random pciking
-     [x] CLimbing Hill
-     [x] Stimulated Annealing
- [x] Dynamic programming

- [ ] Approximation algorithm 
- [  ] Advanced data structure
-   [ ] Graph
-   [ ] Set
-   [ ] Kd Tree
- [ ] Numerical problems
- [ ] Combinatorial problem
- [ ] Graph problem
- [ ] Computational algorithm geometry
- [ ] Set and String problems

- [ ] New algorithm from learning, coding competition, ...

Deadline:
- [ ] December 2020: finish till set and string problem
I know learning has no end to be exacly deadline. This is the deadline that I would learned all I can from the book The Algorithm Design Manual.
