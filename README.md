Hi there!

Thank you for coming to this rep <3

This rep is my learning progress. As a comp sci student, data structure and algorithm is the foundation of computer science. However, only theory about data structure and algorithm is not enough, implementation is not less important. That's why I decided to learn about data structure and practice by coding. 

I try my best to apply clean code principle as well as OOP principles. My assumption is this library will be used in the future for different projects. That's why I tried to apply generic and different OOP principles so future users can use it easily by adding their needs into the my code (without changing my code!!!).

I know that some of code in this project is not clean so give me your review if you are already here!
